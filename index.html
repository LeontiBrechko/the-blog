                <h2>2025-07-19: Just Fucking Write</h2>

                <p>After <a href="https://youtu.be/vagyIcmIGOQ?si=iv9E8eGY66siCkAS">another podcast</a> with a person, whose values and life path resonate with my own, got a motivational kick to do something interesting, hacky and enthusiastic outside of the work and daily routine (both of which I highly enjoy, kindaðŸ˜… most of the time at least).</p>

                <p>One of those side-hustle things I was always passionate about is blog posting, despite not having any outstanding writing skills and being a non-native English speaker. The only experience I had in the past related to writing was English communication classes back in college.</p>

                <p>I tried it previously, but was trying to optimize it too much for specific outcomes, like acquiring an audience and public attention for self-promotion. Plus, I lack the discipline to commit to writing, and it's not something I necessarily enjoy all the time (much less than coding and problem-solving).</p>

                <p>So, this time, I have no specific plans for why and what I'd like to share about. The main thing I know for sure is that I want it to be public no matter what. I want to finally ship something to the world even if the world will reject it and pass it along in the same way as it happens to the most stuff on the Internet. At least my kids will have something to read to gain insights into what I was personally experiencing to be where I am now. I'm mostly a person of meaning (while still caring to ensure my family and I have enough food in the fridge), so would like to bring something useful to the public.</p>

                <p>I know there is too much focus on "I" and not enough on caring for others in the reasoning above. Maybe, through this writing I will evolve my love for others outside the inner circle (cause I'd love to have more reasons to believe in the bright future for humanity).</p>

                <p>That's why I just had enough and said to myself, "just fucking write."</p>
